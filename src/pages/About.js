                <p className="flow-text mb-5 my-section">
                After becoming an empty nester, I decided to take on a whole new role in life. I spent twenty one years working part time as an office manager while my children were in school.  Now I am looking for a fulfilling career as a web developer. 
              <br />
              <br />I am grateful for the opportunity I had to learn new technology and face new challenges as a bootcamp student. 
              
              
              Adding my new coding knowledge to the skills I learned raising three children and running an office, to be task oriented and excellent at time management, will make me a valuable employee to any company. 
              
              
              I am excited for the opportunity to take these new skills and apply them.
              <br />
              <br />On a personal note, entertaining and being creative are my favorite pass times. An example of this passion is the Live Clue game I created using my entire home for the game board. In
              addition, I love pugs, swing dancing, escape rooms, Italy, meeting new people and solving a good mystery.
